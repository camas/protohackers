# Protohackers Solutions

Rust solutions for the [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) challenges.

Spent a bit too much time implementing actors based on <https://ryhl.io/blog/actors-with-tokio/>
and then instead of putting it in a common crate or something like that just c&p and altering for each challenge.

There are a few things I should have improved but moved on once a solution passed.
